You are what you eat... but do you know what that is? 

We have been eating blindly for far too long. **Nutrifeye** lifts the veil by identifying the materials taken in by your body, thanks to the power of Google Cloud Computer Vision and USDA's open source nutritional database.  

Some challenges encountered were native android development, but by taking a step back, we refactored our approach into an even more efficient and global design. We are proud to say that **Nutrifeye** is now available on all popular HTML5 web platforms: 

* Android
* BlackBerry
* iPad
* iPhone
* Windows Mobile
* Mac & PC
